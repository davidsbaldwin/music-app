        <p>Hello Nit,</p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
            Okay. I am only able to view the main page and sign up/login form, so I will provide feedback on that. I realize the following
            this may seem like a lot, but many items are very small and you can do them within a minute.
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>- Background: instead of the purple color, I would prefer a gradient from color #382B11 to #000 (top to bottom), please.</p>
        <p>- Page Title: Please have &amp;quot;Mulder Music Streaming&amp;quot;.</p>
        <p>
            - Header: (1) image (of name) maximum height 100px. (2) Please ensure the name matches with the language, when English it should
            be Ian, when Dutch it should be Jan (currently mis-matched). (3) There is no language flag switch to Dutch (NL) yet? (4) Please
            remove the menu, and have under the header image name in small font (e.g. 12px): STREAMING.
        </p>
        <p>
            - Albums: (1) Please ensure the artwork of each album is square in dimension, currently the height is being stretched. (2)
            Please place the albums in the following order (abbreviation LD = Love Divine): LD 7, LD 6, The Omnipotent, LD 5, Ocean of
            Dreams 2, LD 4, LD 3, LD 2, Christmas, LD 1, The Piano Dreamer, Ian Mulder&amp;#39;s favourite Hymns, Sounds of Silence, Ian
            Mulder in Concert, Coming to America, Ocean of Dreams, Grandezza, Ecossaise 2, Ecossaise 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            - Auth page. (2) I would prefer for the Login screen to be first/default instead of the Sign Up screen (because login screen
            used many more times than sign up). (2) Please move the &amp;quot;Have an accedd code? Create Your Account&amp;quot; up above
            the form fields, to below &amp;quot;Login&amp;quot; text and correct the spelling mistake to &amp;quot;access&amp;quot;. (3) On
            the Sign Up page, there is no access code field yet! How can people sign up? Have you pre-generated access codes already and are
            these being validated? (4) At the bottom, please remove the &amp;quot;Have an accedd code?&amp;quot; text, just have the link
            &amp;quot;Already have an account, login&amp;quot;.
        </p>
